# The Critique of Pure Reason

**By: Immanuel Kant**

---

## 📖 Abstract

> The provided text consists of excerpts from Immanuel Kant's *The Critique of Pure Reason*, which is a foundational work in philosophy. The passages discuss the nature of reason, logic, and knowledge, particularly exploring the concepts of *a priori* and *a posteriori* judgments, analytic and synthetic propositions, and the limits of speculative reason. The text also addresses the structure of the *Critique*, noting that the translation follows the second edition (1787) and includes dedications, such as to Baron von Zedlitz, alongside Kant's philosophical inquiries into the transcendental ideas of psychology, cosmology, and theology, including the famous antinomies and paralogisms. Ultimately, the work asserts the importance of critique and discipline to prevent reason from extending beyond the bounds of possible experience, especially concerning complex concepts like space, time, and causality.
